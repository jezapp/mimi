    <h1 class="print">ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.
      Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so
      well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see
      what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope
      that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so
      different. Here it goes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many
      things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to
      write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
      I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at
      night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the
      wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a
      blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the
      middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in
      autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late;
      I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.
    </p>
